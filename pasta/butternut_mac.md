# Butternut squash mac & cheese

## Ingredients
- Oil/butter **2 Tbsp**
- Garlic **3 Large cloves**
- Butternut squash **2 cups**
- Veg stock **1.5 cups**
- Pasta **1 lb**
- Milk **2 cups**
- Cheese (chedder is bedder) **8 oz**
- Salt n peppa **to taste**
- Silken tofu (optional) **2 cups**

## Instructions
1. Roast squash in oven, can be done ahead of time, or simmer in veg stock w/ garlic until tender
2. Combine squash, stock, milk, and tofu if desired in blender, blend until smooth, season if desired
3. Make your pasta, save some of the starchy water to thin sauce if needed
4. Heat squash mixture on stove, then add shredded cheese to melt and combine
5. Mix it all up, it's mac and cheese!

## Results
Tastes better than boxed mac!  We used about half the called for squash (4 cups) and used some leftover silken tofu instead, which seemed like a good addition.  Be careful if you're blending hot stuff.
