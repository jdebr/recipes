## Ingredients
### Sauce
- Brown sugar **3/4 cup**
- Water **1/2 cup**
- Worcestershire **2 tbsp**
- Rice vinegar **1/3 cup**
- Soy sauce **2 tbsp**
- Garlic **5 cloves**
- Ginger powder **a dash**
- Cayenne powder **a dash**

### Chickon
- Boneless skinless chicken thighs **one flock**
- Peanuts **1/2 cup**
- Green onions
- Cilantro

## Instructions
1. Whisk together sauce ingredients
2. Heat oil in pan to medium
3. Sear chicken
4. Add about 1/3 of sauce, cook down until syrupy (5 minutes on each side)
5. Drain some of the fat off (optional)
6. Add rest of sauce, cook on medium-high for about 25 minutes, turning chicken occasionally
7. WATCH LIKE A GODDAMN HAWK DURING LAST 5-10 MINUTES, WHEN IT REDUCES IT WILL BURN QUICKLY
8. Add cilantro, green onions and peanuts during last 5 minutes or so
9. Serve over rice

## Results
Pretty good even when a little burned :) Drained about half of the fat, not sure if it was necessary but probably a good choice.  Forgot to add peanuts, green onions and cilantro in my panic.  Might be good to cut chicken thighs up into medium sized chunks for better sauce coverage and ease of cooking.  Could have added more cayenne for my taste, or maybe chili powder.
