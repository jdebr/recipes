## Results
Pretty freaking tasty.  I wish I would have cooked the mushrooms down a bit first, maybe just with the ground beef.  Probably if using white or yellow onions you want to cook them too, we just used green and threw them in and it was pretty good though.  The heat from just a sprinkle of cayenne was perfect for my taste.   I used cream of mushroom soup for extra mushroom flavor, seemed good. Overall maybe a touch runny, not sure if adding more bread, less milk, or just cooking longer would help a bit - also mushrooms probably released some moisture.  Still, it set up pretty well and tasted great so no major complaints.
