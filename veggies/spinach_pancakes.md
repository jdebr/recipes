# Spinach Pancakes

## Ingredients
- Cooked Spinach **16 oz**
- Onion **1/2**
- Garlic **1 Tbsp**
- Eggs **3 big'uns**
- Salt **1 tsp**
- Pepper **1/2 tsp**
- Parmesan Cheese **1/4 cup**
- Flour (rice, almond, or whatever) **1/4 cup**
- Panko (optional) **1/4 cup** 
- Oil for frying

## Instructions
1. Mix it all up and fry it

## Results
These are pretty great.  Use as much spinach as you have, it really is more of an onion pancake in my opinion.  Could add any additional spices to flavor it but it's already pretty good.  Added panko the second time and I liked the extra crunch.
