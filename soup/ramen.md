# Fake Ramen

Partly based on [fox and briar recipe](https://www.foxandbriar.com/easy-chicken-ramen/)

## Ingredients

- noodles (used japanese udon)
- eggs
- chicken breast **about a pound**
- chicken stock (low sodium) **4 cups**
- rice vinegar  **1/4 cup**
- soy sauce **1/2 cup**
- garlic **5 cloves**
- ginger **1 chonk**
- worcestershire sauce **2 Tbsp**
- mushrooms **a pack**
- yellow onion **1/2**
- carrots **like 5**
- green onion **1 cup**
- cilantro **whatever**
- sesame oil **a bit**
- spinach **couple handfuls**
- sugar **a pinch, maybe 1.5 tsp**
- sesame seeds

## Instructions

1. Soft boil eggs, ~ 7-8 minutes, then into ice bath
2. Prepare noodles according to package - rinse and cool
3. Dice chicken into chonks, lightly fry in `(sesame|olive)` oil til browned
4. Cut y. onion and carrot into small slices, begin frying in leftover oil
5. Combine stock, soy, vinegar, garlic, ginger, worcestershire, and sugar and bring to a boil
6. Reduce to simmer, add onions, carrots, mushrooms, and about half of the green onions and cilantro
7. Taste; cut with water if too salty (I added 1/2 cup)
8. Simmer ~5 minutes
9. Add chicken and egg, simmer ~1 minute to heat up
10. Turn off heat, add spinach
11. Put noodles in bottom of bowl, add soup on top, garnish with cilantro, green onion and sesame seeds

## Results

Pretty good, a bit on the sour/vinegar side, worcestershire and vinegar could be toned down a bit.  Wish it was sweeter, maybe more sugar, or some fish sauce or fish flakes?  No spice, could add sriracha or chili powder.  Could have more onions too.  Overcooked chicken slightly, should just finish cooking it on the stove and then just throw it in at the end, instead I boiled it for a couple minutes.  Eggs were perfect.
