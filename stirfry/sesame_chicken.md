## Results
Delicious.  Prepping everything ahead of time would be smart but I just winged the whole thing and it turned out fine.  Sauce was actually thick for a change.  Instead of BBQ + Worcester the recipe calls for hoisin, so there's that.  Not much I would change.  Fresh green onions on top might be good, but when aren't they?
