# Cinnamon Rolls

## Ingredients
- Bread dough stuff (I use a sourdough starter) **About 4 cups of flour's worth**

### Filling
- Butter **1/2 cup**
- Cinnamon **2 Tbsp**
- Brown sugar **1 cup**
- Cardamom (optional) **1-2 tsp** 
- Cream (optional) **1/4 cup**

### Frosting
- Cream cheese **4 oz**
- Butter **1/2 cup**
- Vanilla (or other extract, like maple) **1-2 tsp**
- Powdered sugar **2 cups**

## Instructions
1. Make your bread dough.  Anything on the sweeet side should work.  Instructions are for my sourdough recipe (which has a lot of sugar) - baking times may require adjustment depending on the dough you use.
2. After dough has risen, roll that thing out.  Looking for approximately 24"x15" rectangle, dough will be like a 1/4" thick.  Doesn't need to be perfect, but the closer to a rectangle the better then ends will turn out.
3. Make the filling by just melting the butter and stirring in the brown sugar, cinnamon, and cardamom until evenly combined.  Spread over dough, leaving a small 1/2" border of dough on the long sides.
4. Roll it up!  Gently take one of the long edges and slightly pull and fold over to start rolling.  Continue gently pulling and rolling to get a tight even spiral.
5. Slice the roll into 12 discs.  Try to keep them uniform in size.
6. Arrange discs evently in a greased 9"x13".  Keep roll tails towards each other to help them stay together if needed.
7. Cover and let rise for 20-30 minutes. Pre-heat oven to 375-400 F.
8. If you want gooey rolls, take 1/4 cream and gently warm in microwave, about 15 seconds.  Pour gently over the top of the rolls to cover evenly.  It will pool a little on the sides.
9. Pop 'em in the oven.  Cooking times generally 20-30 minutes, depending on dough and the phase of the moon.  Adding the cream may add a few minutes.  
10. Rolls should be golden brown on the top and just firm enough to tap on the top when done.  Remove from oven and cool on a rack.
11. Make the frosting by creaming together butter and cream cheese, then adding the sugar and vanilla and blending until smooth.  Do what you will with the end result.

## Results
Used half of my sourdough recipe for a loaf of bread and rolled the other half out into cinammon rolls.  Could have used slightly more dough for taller rolls, but worked out pretty nicely anyway.  I used the warm cream on top before baking and baked at 400 for exactly half an hour (opened the oven twice to check at 20 and 25 minutes).  I liked the cardamom which I just added to the recipe on a whim.  Frosting is perfect - original recipe calls for slightly more cream cheese and slightly less butter but I only had leftover cream cheese so I used what I put in the ingredients and thought it turned out great.  Feel free to adjust the ratio.
