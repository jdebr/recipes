## Results
Really good.  Don't be shy with the garlic.  Can also be seasoned any way you want, a little Red Robin was good on ours.  You can really overstuff these, some of it might spill out but you can just serve it on top afterwards.  Try to angle the pockets down, and prop the chicken up to keep most of it inside.
